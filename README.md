# HAKCafe Vuln Site

Welcome to the **HAKCafe Vuln Site** â€“ a simple, browser-based vulnerable web app designed for cybersecurity students to explore and practice web application security concepts.

This project simulates a basic challenge environment with clickable tiles that may correspond to various exercises or hidden vulnerabilities. Perfect for labs, workshops, or CTF-style events.

- Currently includes 27 different challenges.
  - CTF-style challenges that require a found flag for completion.
  - Multiple-choice-style challenges that require selecting an answer from a dropdown menu.

- Custom status output area

## TO-DO

- Add fourth set of challenges (bring total to 36)
- Fix commented out `keep-going` button in both index and script
- Fix `refresh-tiles` so that it cycles in 9 unique challenges (not repeating ones that were in the last batch).
- Fix `keep-going` so that it only cycles in unsolved challenges
