# HAKCafe Vuln Site

Welcome to the **HAKCafe Vuln Site** â€“ a simple, browser-based vulnerable web app designed for cybersecurity students to explore and practice web application security concepts.

This project simulates a basic challenge environment with clickable tiles that may correspond to various exercises or hidden vulnerabilities. Perfect for labs, workshops, or CTF-style events.
